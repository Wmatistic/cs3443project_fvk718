# Workout App
**This is a workout app made in Android Studio using Java 26 for CS3443 Application Programming**

The app is made to track and store workouts made by the user. Stored workouts contain exercises and sets also input by the user which can be later called and displayed for reuse.

## Instructions for Running the App
Open the project in android studio. Once open, there are initial example workouts placed in the asset folder that will be copied into the internal storage of the simulator on the first run, you may remove these if you want before running. However, please do not add new workouts manually as the format may be incorrect and cause errors.

If Android Studio has loaded the project properly then you should be able to run the app out of the box with no changes.

If you have any issues with this please email me at Johnmatistic@gmail.com

## Known Issues
As mentioned above, adding workout csv files manually can easily create errors because of discrepancies in formatting.

The app sometimes slows down because of an unknown reason when Android Studio has been open for longer periods of time, a restart of your Android Studio should fix this.

When adding a set to an exercise the status of the check boxes for each set is reset to unchecked. This is a known issue and has to do with the way the set list is updated once a new set is added. A fix is in the works, however it will not be ready before submission.
